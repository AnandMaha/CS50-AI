# Analysis

## Layer 5, Head 8
In Layer 5, Head 8, the attention head appears to focus on establishing connections between verbs and their direct objects. The attention diagrams consistently show that tokens corresponding to verbs have a higher attention weight on the tokens representing their respective direct objects. For instance, in the sentence "The cat chased the [MASK]," the attention head highlights a strong connection between the verb "chased" and the direct object "cat." This pattern holds true for various sentences, suggesting that this attention head has learned to pay attention to the syntactic relationship between verbs and their direct objects.

Example Sentences:
- "The dog fetched the [MASK] from the yard."
- "She wrote a [MASK] on the whiteboard."

## Layer 8, Head 3
In Layer 8, Head 3, the attention head seems to be attentive to the relationship between prepositions and their associated objects. When examining sentences with prepositional phrases, such as "The book is on the [MASK]," the attention diagrams consistently reveal a higher attention weight between the preposition "on" and its object "book." This suggests that the attention head has learned to capture the spatial relationship indicated by prepositions and the corresponding objects they modify.

Example Sentences:
- "The keys are under the [MASK]."
- "He placed the cup on the [MASK]."
